Terms of use of many crypto exchange platforms outline a refund decline disclaimer for the cases if the client loses his deposit. That means an exchange initially admits that something might go wrong. Do you still store your coins on Binance?<br>
After a series of devastating crypto thefts of 2017-2018 confidence for these platforms is no more. But what should a traders do if they want to save their portfolio and remain a convenient access to the funds in case of need? They are offered with a choice of various multicurrency wallets. Let's take a closer look.<br>
Cold or hot?<br>
Cryptocurrency wallets can be divided into two large groups - online and offline. Wallets that require an internet connection are called “hot.” Wallets that store your funds regardless of it are called "cold."<br>
Online wallets are services or platforms that provide a storing services with a private key allocated on a remote servers. In addition to storage, many online wallets offer exchange services. Their advantages include a simple registration process and no need to go through KYC procedure or any other of identity verification, which you can meet on most crypto exchange platforms.<br>
However, no matter how perfect secure mechanism of online wallet may seem, the probability of successful hacker attack remains. There were cases when fraudsters turned out to be the founders of the service themselves.<br>
Popular online wallets are:<br>
- Blockchain.com, one of the oldest official wallets of the Bitcoin network, which today supports native wallets of ETH, BCH and XLM. It has minimal fees due to the absence of intermediaries and direct communication with the blockchain.<br>
- HolyTransaction. Appeared in 2014, now works with more than ten of the most traded cryptocurrencies.<br>
Offline wallets work without internet connection, and therefore has none hacking options, unless the wallet itself is stolen. But it’s good to know how they differ from each other.<br>

Mobile wallet. These are applications that are installed directly on a smartphone and allow easily pay with a cryptocurrency where it’s accepted, by generating or scaning a QR code.<br>
• Xapo. Made in California, supports Bitcoin, insures funds and has debit card linked to a phone number option.<br>
• Coinomi. Quite popular among users of Android devices, supports more than 50 tokens.<br>
Browser wallet. These are the browser extensions. They are ascetic and have minimum of opportunities, but always at hand when you browse.<br>
• Jaxx. Works with 14 cryptocurrencies, built on open source, has versions for different OS.<br>
Hardware wallet. These wallets look like a flash drive or other lightweight portable equipment. They are ideal if you do not intend to spend your cryptocurrency, because it is extremely inconvenient to use them for paying.<br>
• Ledger USB Bitcoin Wallet;<br>
• Trezor;<br>
• KeepKay.<br>
Desktop wallet. These are the most secured wallets, but to use them one has to store the whole blockchain on a computer, as well as constant update it. One blockchain might take more than 100 gb of hard drive space! That’s why this variant is not for everybody, especially not for those, who actively use his coins. There are also “thin” versions of dekstop wallets, that are less reliable.<br>
• Bitcoin Core. The original installation file for the Bitcoin node, which was posted by Satoshi Nakamoto. Exists in versions for any operating system.<br>
• Exodus. Works with seven cryptocurrencies and is able to exchange them.<br>
Paper wallet. The original storage option, suitable for those who wants to leave money for the distant future. It is a printout of a QR code with an address and a private key. Just don’t lose it!<br>
• bitaddress.org.<br>
Everyone should choose a wallet according to his needs. For the Level2 traders the best solution is a wallet that allows to quickly sign a smart contract with the exchange and freeze the funds in the smart channel. The amount of funds frozen will determine access to a similar deposit of the same cryptocurrency within the platform.<br>
The entire trading history and balance changes are recorded in the API, which doesn’t allow fraud from both sides. The smart channel has a time of action and after it expires, the mutual settlements will be done according to the API records. After that the funds will be unfrozen and returned to the user’s wallet. If a trader decides to leave the platform before smart contract expires, he just needs to send a command to the smart channel and after a quick mutual settlements immediately use the money earned!
