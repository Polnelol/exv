Putting money in the bank has long ceased to be relevant, so the search for new cryptocurrency investment opportunities is a completely natural process. But on the other hand, who wants to invest in a falling cryptocurrency market? However, there are a number of strategies to minimize risks, which we will talk about today.<br>
If you decided to invest in cryptocurrencies, it’s better to have an investment strategy. This is what can give you an advantage over other market participants, who often have no strategy at all. If you also have discipline and strong nerves in addition to strategy, this will further increase your chance to profit from investments.<br>
The basic rule that should be used regardless of which investment strategy you prefer: do not put all your eggs in one basket. This means that you must not invest all your money or borrowed funds. You must invest only the sum, that you can forget about for a long time.<br>
Strategy 1 — Buy & Hold<br>
This is the simplest and one of the most effective strategies. Its problem is the long-termness: you will have to store the cryptocurrencies for at least several months up to several years. When choosing the currency for this strategy, you need to pay close attention to the fundamental factors: the demand among major investors, a professional and proven development team, technical capabilities of the project and a road map, which clearly outlines plans for the future (the more interesting these plans are, the better)
Buy & Hold is probably the best strategy for novice traders. It was used by all those people who became millionaires due to the growth of Bitcoin. But if you invest long-term, you also need to be prepared for bad times. The value of the assets may fall for some period, and you will need an endurance to remain calm and not sell everything with losses.<br>
Advantages of the strategy:<br>
— It’s easy<br>
 — A currency is stored in a single wallet<br>
 — High long distance profit<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
 — The risk of a draw-down<br>
 — It’s necessary not to use the funds while storing<br>
Strategy 2 Portfolio Investment<br>
Unlike Buy & Hold, where you keep one cryptocurrency only, this strategy is about storing many different coins at once. Such an approach reduces the risk of draw-down of investments to a minimum. The average number of coins in a portfolio can vary from 5 to 15, but depends, first of all, on you and your capabilities. The choice of currencies for a portfolio should be determined by its cap volume and trading volume. The higher these numbers are for a particular assert, the more coins should be added to the portfolio.<br>
One of the disadvantages of this strategy is a necessity to find a secure wallet for every coin you store, since crypto exchanges cannot provide safety of your funds for a long-term. You can find the list of reliable cryptowallets on different portals, and here’s an exchange that uses smart channel technology, letting you to store money without any risk.<br>
