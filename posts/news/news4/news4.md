Decentralized exchange not only keeps money safe and allows to trade without control of third parties. It can also show what the decentralized internet of the future can be like.<br>

The ballad of centralized internet<br>
Today internet is centralized and belongs to companies that provide communication services  IT corporations mostly. They control the servers through which our data flows and it is from these servers information can be stolen. But the thing is that stealing is not always necessary as many IT giants willingly sell information to third parties.<br>
Just think that as soon as any of your private data enters the network, it immediately cease to be private and belongs to everyone from that very moment. Perhaps the lack of privacy is the main problem of our time.<br>

What will dInternet looks like?<br>
It can be compared to a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, which allows users to store money on their side, thereby not subjecting it to be stolen. A good example of such an exchange is the Level 2 platform, which doesn't use any centralized crypto wallets, but instead simply frozes funds inside a special smart channels managed by a smart contracts.<br>
This solution makes data stored in a decentralized fashion. Currently the entire Big Data is controlled by a small group of companies, but in a dInternet any sites, services and applications will be controlled by everyone and no one simultaneously. They will belong to the users themselves and will be stored on their computers or cloud servers. As a result, there will be no need in intermediaries no more as their functions will be divided among all users of dInternet. The weak and unsafe encryption protocols, most of which were developed forty years ago, will finally become a thing of the past.<br>

Without a special identifier no one can access the frozen funds in the smart channels on Level2. The same way each user of the dInternet will have a unique identifier, which will serve as the only option to retain access to his stored data. Such an architecture will create a trusted environment where simply be no room for fraud or theft. Also every participant of such a network, whether he uses a hard disk or a cloud storage, will be able to encrypt files and thus raise their security to the blockchain level. Accessing the necessary information, deleting, adding or sending will be fast as in a torrent trackers, ad storage and transfer of data will be based on the p2p principle.<br>

What can it bring to users?<br>
The same thing that Level2 brings its users today. A complete protection from:<br>
- hacker attacks<br>
- theft or sale of funds or personal data<br>
Today, itâ€™s still up to technological solutions that can create a similar infrastructure for the Internet of Big Data. However, an example of smaller scale, such as Level2 cryptocurrency exchange, have already successfully proved its efficiency today. This gives a firm conviction that the decentralized future of the Internet is not far from where we are now.
